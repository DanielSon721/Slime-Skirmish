## 🎮 Gameplay

The premise of the game is you are a character in a clearing in a forest with a gun, and **slime** monsters spawn from the forest and try to kill you.

- If they touch you, you die.  
- You can point and click with your mouse to aim and shoot your gun to kill the slimes.  
- A timer at the top of the screen tracks how long you've lived for.  
- There are **4 difficulty levels**:
  - Easy  
  - Medium  
  - Hard  
  - Impossible

## 🛠️ How I Made Slime Skirmish

### 🌲 Map

To begin, I designed the pixelated forest map using assets from the Unity Asset Store.  
The forest clearing is populated with **rocks**, **rivers**, and **shrubbery**.

### 👤 Character

Next, I designed the player's controllable character.  
Again, I used assets from the Unity Asset Store to bring a cute, white character to life with idle and running animations.  
The player can move **up, down, left, right**, and the diagonals between using **WASD** or the **arrow keys**.

Then I gave the character a **gun** that shoots a bullet in the direction of the mouse on click.

### 🧟 Slime Monsters

Next, I designed **3 species** of slime monster taken from the Unity Asset Store, each with different **size** and **speed**.

I set approximately **40 spawn points** hidden within the forest that spawn slimes randomly, at an average rate determined by the difficulty level.

The slime monsters are programmed with **A.I. pathing**, so they walk around obstacles on the map such as trees, shrubbery, and bodies of water.

### 🕐 Point System

Lastly, I implemented a simple **stopwatch** at the top of the screen, tracking how long the player has lived for.

The player also has the option to **ramp up the difficulty**, although it has no effect on the point system (survival time) of the game. It is merely for the purpose of making the game more challenging for fun.
