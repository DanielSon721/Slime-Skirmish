## 🛠️ Development

### 🌲 Map

To begin, I designed a pixelated forest map using assets from the Unity Asset Store.  
The forest clearing is populated with **stones**, **rivers**, and **shrubbery**.

### 👤 Character

Next, I designed the player's controllable character.  
Again, I used asset packs from the Unity Asset Store to bring a cute, white character to life with idle and running animations.  
The player can move **up, down, left, right**, and the diagonals between using **WASD** or the **arrow keys**.

Then I armed the character with a **gun** that shoots a bullet in the direction of the mouse on click.

### 🧟 Slime Monsters

Next, I designed **3 species** of slime monster taken from the Unity Asset Store, each with different **size** and **speed**.

I set approximately **40 spawn points** hidden within the forest that spawn slimes randomly, at an average rate determined by the difficulty level.

The slime monsters are programmed with **A.I. pathing** to naviate around obstacles (trees, water, etc.).

### 🕐 Point System

Lastly, I implemented a simple **stopwatch** at the top of the screen, tracking how long the player has lived for.

The player also has the option to ramp up the difficulty, although it has no effect on the point system (survival time) of the game. It is merely for the purpose of making the game more challenging for fun.
